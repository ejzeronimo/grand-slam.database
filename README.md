## Prerequisites
This assumes that there is some hosted SQL server. We were provided one for class so initialization of one is not included.

I used this link [here](https://container-registry.oracle.com/ords/ocr/ba/mysql/community-server) to spin up my own local dev SQL server.
## Issues
For any issues please create an issue in this repo and I will try to respond promptly.
